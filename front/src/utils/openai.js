  "${userAnswer}"

  "${baseAnswer}"

  Is my answer to the prompt correct and complete? If it is essentially right (it doesn't have to match exactly), say "Correct". If it isn't, your answer must comply with the following rules:
  1. Explain as briefly as possible why my answer is wrong or what is it missing.
  2. Begin your answer with "Incorrect.", followed by your explanation.
  3. Write your explanation in the same language as my answer.
